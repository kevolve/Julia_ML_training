        "Welcome to \"your first day\" with the Julia language. Hopefully this unit will also be instructive if this is your second, or third, or 50th day with Julia. Still, we take an approach of zero experience with Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start with installation. We then explore basic Julia code on a simple example. Then after we survey the past and present of Julia we explore all the modes in which you can run Julia. We then move onto the package manager. Every unit has its own **Julia environment** and so does this one. So we explore that environment and more. We then use two simple mathematical stories, square roots, and factorials, as a means to explore some language features and peculiarities. In particular, we wish to explore [Julia types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/) and the key property of [Julia multiple dispatch of methods](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/). We then close by exploring integration with R and Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "The recommended way to install Julia is using [JuliaUp](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).\n",
        "This is a small program that maintains multiple isolated Julia versions on your system simultaneously, and also helps update to newer versions as they become available.\n",
        "Do not confuse this with the [package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/), which is used to install packages within Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this course we recommended installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [Julia plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).\n",
        "Once you have Julia installed, it's common to add a few packages to your Julia base environment.\n",
        "In our case we install [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for running Julia within [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/),\n",
        "[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) to try out [Pluto notebooks](https://plutojl.org/), [QuartoNotebookRunner.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/QuartoNotebookRunner.jl) which integrates with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create or update typeset notes like the ones you are currently reading,\n",
        "and [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) which helps with development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you may also want to clone this repo and instantiate a separate Julia environment for each unit of the course (we'll walk you through those steps soon).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary to install Julia and the supporting software, follow these steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install Julia (and JuliaUp). Follow the instructions in the [Official Julia installation page](https://julialang.org/install/). You'll run a shell script (Mac/Linux) or use the Microsoft store on Windows. Once installed, restart your terminal, after which `juliaup` and `julia` should be available in your terminal. Then try,\n",
        "    a. In the terminal run `juliaup` and you should see a short help listing.\n",
        "    b. In the terminal try `julia` in the command line and you should enter the Julia REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). You should see a prompt, `julia> ` and try `1+1` and hit ENTER. To exit, hit Ctrl+D, or run the function `exit()`.\n",
        "2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't already have it installed.\n",
        "3. Install the [Julia plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/). See instructions [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/#Installing-the-Julia-extension).\n",
        "4. Install the above mentioned Julia packages into your base environment. You can do this for each of the packages using the package manager as follows.\n",
        "    a. Run `julia` and enter package manager mode by hitting `]`. You should see the prompt change to `(@vX.X) pkg>` where X.X is the julia version you have installed.\n",
        "    b. Type `update` and ENTER to update the list of available packages from the registry.\n",
        "    c. Type `add IJulia` and ENTER to install IJulia.jl. \n",
        "    d. Similarly `add Pluto` to install Pluto.jl. \n",
        "    e. Similarly `add QuartoNotebookRunner` to install QuartoNotebookRunner.jl. In each case you can use TAB to autocomplete (or hit TAB twice to see all available options).\n",
        "    f. Finally `add Revise`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this course was created with Julia version 1.11.5.\n",
        "You can see the version of Julia that you are running when you first run Julia, or by running `versioninfo()` in the Julia REPL.\n",

        "- **Origins and History**\n",
        "  - [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)) was conceived in 2009 by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman and first publicly released in 2012.\n",
        "  - Born out of a dissatisfaction with existing technical computing languages for scientific and numerical computing.\n",
        "  - Built with the promise to be “as fast as C, as easy as Python, as flexible as Ruby, and as powerful for statistics as R.”\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Core Ideas**\n",
        "  - Designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing.\n",
        "  - Combines the ease of use of dynamic languages (like Python or R) with performance close to statically-typed, compiled languages (like C and Fortran).\n",
        "  - Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation via LLVM, meaning code is compiled to efficient machine code at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Benefits**\n",
        "  - **Speed:** Approaches or matches C/Fortran in performance for many tasks. (Sometimes non-optimized generic Julia code compiles to be faster than non-optimized C code.)\n",
        "  - **Multiple Dispatch:** Allows defining function behavior across combinations of argument types, enabling more expressive and extensible code.\n",
        "  - **Rich Ecosystem:** Growing collection of packages for data science, machine learning, optimization, and visualization.\n",
        "  - **Easy Syntax:** Friendly to users familiar with Python, MATLAB, or R.\n",
        "  - **Metaprogramming:** Powerful features like macros for generating and transforming code.\n",
        "  - **Native Parallelism:** Designed with parallel and distributed computing in mind from the start.\n",
        "  - **Interoperability:** Easily calls C, Fortran, and Python libraries for integrating with existing codebases.\n",

It also contains metadata about your project itself, such as its name, unique identified (UUID), and version. It's concise and human-readable, making it easy to see the high-level requirements of your project.\n",

It's much longer and more detailed than `Project.toml`. This file is crucial for guaranteeing reproducibility.

        "### Applications vs Libraries (advanced)\n",
        "\n",
        "In Julia, package management differs slightly between applications and libraries. In this context, applications are programs intended to be run directly, whereas libraries are reusable collections of routines made to be embedded within applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications will often include exact dependencies and include both `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` in version control systems (such as `git`) to guarantee an exact copy of the same dependencies are included on each installation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Libraries on the other hand are made to work within applications, and so must interoperate with a wider set of other libraries. That is, libraries need to be compatible with more than just one exact version of each of its dependencies (otherwise an application using several libraries would quickly fail to resolve dependencies if they depend on different versions of some transitive dependency). Libraries therefore often omit `Manifest.toml` from version control, and instead track compatibility via the `[compat]` section in `Project.toml`. An example can be found in the [`Project.toml` file of `JuMP.jl`](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/Project.toml) (JuMP is a Julia library for mathematical optimization).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instantiating Environments\n",
        "\n",
        "When you receive a Julia project from someone else (e.g. by cloning it from a Git repository), it should include the `Project.toml` and possibly a `Manifest.toml` file. To set up a compatible environment, you activate the project and then `instantiate` it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "cd TheirJuliaProject/\n",
        "julia --project=.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, within the Julia REPL:\n",

        "```\n",
        "(@TheirJuliaProject) pkg> instantiate\n",
        "```\n",

        "*If you are not familiar with package management in Python, we recommend skipping this section.*\n",

        "In this section, we briefly compare package management in Julia and Python, so that those familiar with the latter can quickly get up and running in Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core correspondence can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Python Virtual Environments = Julia Environments/Projects:** Python uses `venv` or `conda` for creating isolated environments. In Julia, the concept is directly supported by the built-in package manager and is often referred to simply as an \"environment\" or a \"project.\"\n",
        "* **Activating an environment:** In Python `source venv/bin/activate` = running Julia with `julia --project=.` or `Pkg.activate(\".\")`.\n",
        "* **Dependency Files `requirements.txt` = `Project.toml`:** Python projects commonly use `requirements.txt` to list direct dependencies. Julia uses `Project.toml`.\n",
        "* **Dependency Pinning `pip-compile/lockfiles` = `Manifest.toml`:** Python projects sometimes use `pip-tools` or other addons to `pip` to pin dependencies exactly (e.g. with a `requirements.in` vs `requirements.txt`). Julia `Manifest.toml` which is built into the language.\n",
        "* **Installing individual Dependencies `pip install package` = `Pkg.add(\"package\")`:** In Python, one typically installs dependencies with `pip install package`: however note that this does not automatically list it in `requirements.txt`. In contrast, Julia's `Pkg.add(\"package\")` adds it into `Package.toml`\n",
        "* **Installing project dependencies `source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` = `Pkg.instantiate()`:** both will install dependencies listed in the dependency file (`requirements.txt` in Python, `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml` in Julia).\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, Julia's `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` combined with `Pkg.instantiate()` provide a more powerful and built-in mechanism for reproducible environments than the standard `venv` and `requirements.txt` workflow in Python, abstracting away some of the manual steps and providing stronger version locking. This reflects the fact that Julia's package managed is a generation or two newer than the one in Python. There have been advances in package management in Python, such as with the `uv` project, but these are nascent compared to the Julia built-in ecosystem.\n",
